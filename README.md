## Introduction

Digital advertising requires high-quality, engaging content that captures the audience's attention. This project addresses this need by automating the creation of storyboards through semantic alignment of images and text. By utilizing deep learning algorithms, the system generates storyboards that are both visually appealing and contextually relevant, reducing the need for extensive manual effort.

## Features

- **Semantic Image Analysis:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze and understand images.
- **Text Analysis and Alignment:** Leverages natural language processing (NLP) to analyze text and align it with relevant images.
- **Automated Storyboard Creation:** Synthesizes storyboards by combining analyzed images and text.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates the quality of generated storyboards using various metrics.
- **User Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system and generate storyboards.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, NLTK, SpaCy
- **Cloud Services:** AWS for GPU processing
- **Others:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., venv, virtualenv)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git
    cd projectname
    ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up AWS for GPU Processing (if applicable):**

    Follow AWS documentation to set up an EC2 instance with GPU support and configure it for remote code execution.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Prepare Your Data:**

    Ensure you have the images and text data required for the storyboard synthesis.

2. **Execute the Main Script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Interact with the User Interface:**

    Access the provided UI to input data and generate storyboards.

### Example Commands

- **Train the Model:**

    ```bash
    python train.py --data_path /path/to/data --epochs 50
    ```

- **Evaluate the Model:**

    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model
    ```
